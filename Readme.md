## Project Structure

Youâ€™ll find a few folders in the project, but the most important ones are:

- **public/** â€“ Contains all frontend assets.
- **ip-api/** â€“ A simple API to retrieve your IP address. Sneaky, right? >:]

### A Note on `index.html`

The `index.html` file is just a **template** â€” donâ€™t bother writing HTML directly into it. It gets dynamically replaced by `index.js`.

### The Magic Happens in `index.js`

Weâ€™re keeping things lean and mean with **vanilla JavaScript** â€” no frameworks like React (yet ðŸ˜¢). That means everything you see is handcrafted with love and pure JS.
